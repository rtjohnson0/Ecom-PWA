# Authorization Page + PWA



The task was to build a UI for my products page while connecting it to my own MongoDB Atlas Database. Only allowing the admin to login and see the products to manipulate them if needed. Created a PWA to allow anyone to add this to their home screen on their phone! This task was built and launched on Heroku by Reginald Johnson Jr
